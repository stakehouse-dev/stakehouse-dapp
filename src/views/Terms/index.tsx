            The Stakehouse Protocol (the &quot;Protocol&quot;) is a decentralized cross-chain
            protocol that enables permissionless programmable Ethereum staking using Ethereum
            Deposit Contract, the protocol is developed and provided by Blockswap Labs
            (&quot;Labs&quot;). The Protocol leverages an optimistic UTXO mechanism through a
            Registry contract architecture to ensure full public verifiability of its assets
            registered against the Ethereum Validator balance on the Ethereum Consensus layer by a
            user to enable liquid positions for the underlying assets to be used for DeFi purposes
            on Ethereum or other Blockchains without sacrificing decentralization or security. There
            is currently one version of the Stakehouse protocol (v1) which is provided by Labs under
            a BSL license with a delayed open source option available ({' '}

                    It is important to understand that neither we or any affiliated entity is a
                    party to any transaction on the blockchain networks underlying the Protocol; we
                    do not have possession, custody, or control over any cryptoassets appearing on
                    the interface services; and we do not have possession, custody, or control over
                    any user’s funds. Further, we do not store, send, or receive any cryptoassets.
                    You understand that when you interact with the Protocol smart contracts, you
                    retain control over your cryptoassets at all times. The private key associated
                    with the wallet address from which you transfer cryptoassets or the private key
                    associated is the only private key that can control the cryptoassets you
                    transfer into the smart contracts. You alone are responsible for securing your
                    private keys. We do not have access to your private keys. Due to the
                    non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology, we are not

                    Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including

                    &quot;Disputes&quot;) by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such good faith
                    negotiations require, at a minimum, that you provide us with a written notice
                    specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. We shall have thirty (30) days
                    to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after you sent the initial
                    notice, we shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by
                    telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If we are unable to resolve the

                    mediate their Dispute, or you may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth

                    You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures

                    experience adjudicating matters involving Internet technology, software
                    applications, financial transactions, and, ideally, blockchain technology. The
                    arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the
                    &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; subsection of these Terms as to the types
                    and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The prevailing
